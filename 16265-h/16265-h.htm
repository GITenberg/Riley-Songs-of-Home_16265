    <h3>WE MUST GET HOME</h3><br>
    We must get home! How could we stray like this?&mdash;<br>
    So far from home, we know not where it is,&mdash;<br>
    Only in some fair, apple-blossomy place<br>
    Of children's faces&mdash;and the mother's face&mdash;<br>
    We dimly dream it, till the vision clears<br>
    Even in the eyes of fancy, glad with tears.<br>
    <br>
    We must get home&mdash;for we have been away<br>
    So long, it seems forever and a day!<br>
    And O so very homesick we have grown,<br>
    The laughter of the world is like a moan<br>
    In our tired hearing, and its song as vain,&mdash;<br>
    We must get home&mdash;we must get home again!<br>
    <br>
    We must get home! With heart and soul we yearn<br>
    To find the long-lost pathway, and return!...<br>
    The child's shout lifted from the questing band<br>
    Of old folk, faring weary, hand in hand,<br>
    But faces brightening, as if clouds at last<br>
    Were showering sunshine on us as we passed.<br>
    <br>
    We must get home: It hurts so staying here,<br>
    Where fond hearts must be wept out tear by tear,<br>
    And where to wear wet lashes means, at best,<br>
    When most our lack, the least our hope of rest&mdash;<br>
    When most our need of joy, the more our pain&mdash;<br>
    We must get home&mdash;we must get home again!<br>
    <br>

    <center>
<img src="images/illus0013.jpg" width="365" height="475" alt="Seated woman with two children kneeling on the floor before her" title="" />
    </center><br>
    We must get home&mdash;home to the simple things&mdash;<br>
    The morning-glories twirling up the strings<br>
    And bugling color, as they blared in blue-<br>
    And-white o'er garden-gates we scampered through;<br>
    The long grape-arbor, with its under-shade<br>
    Blue as the green and purple overlaid.<br>
    <br>
    We must get home: All is so quiet there:<br>
    The touch of loving hands on brow and hair&mdash;<br>
    Dim rooms, wherein the sunshine is made mild&mdash;<br>
    The lost love of the mother and the child<br>
    Restored in restful lullabies of rain,&mdash;<br>
    We must get home&mdash;we must get home again!<br>
    <br>
    The rows of sweetcorn and the China beans<br>
    Beyond the lettuce-beds where, towering, leans<br>
    The giant sunflower in barbaric pride<br>
    Guarding the barn-door and the lane outside;<br>
    The honeysuckles, midst the hollyhocks,<br>
    That clamber almost to the martin-box.<br>
    <br>
    We must get home, where, as we nod and drowse,<br>
    Time humors us and tiptoes through the house,<br>
    And loves us best when sleeping baby-wise,<br>
    With dreams&mdash;not tear-drops&mdash;brimming our clenched
    eyes,&mdash;<br>
    Pure dreams that know nor taint nor earthly stain&mdash;<br>
    We must get home&mdash;we must get home again!<br>
    <br>
    We must get home! The willow-whistle's call<br>
    Trills crisp and liquid as the waterfall&mdash;<br>
    Mocking the trillers in the cherry-trees<br>
    And making discord of such rhymes as these,<br>
    That know nor lilt nor cadence but the birds<br>
    First warbled&mdash;then all poets afterwards.<br>
    <br>
    We must get home; and, unremembering there<br>
    All gain of all ambition otherwhere,<br>
    Rest&mdash;from the feverish victory, and the crown<br>
    Of conquest whose waste glory weighs us down.&mdash;<br>
    Fame's fairest gifts we toss back with disdain&mdash;<br>
    We must get home&mdash;we must get home again!<br>
    <br>
    We must get home again&mdash;we must&mdash;we must!&mdash;<br>
    (Our rainy faces pelted in the dust)<br>
    Creep back from the vain quest through endless strife<br>
    To find not anywhere in all of life<br>
    A happier happiness than blest us then ...<br>
    We must get home&mdash;we must get home again!<br>

    <h3>JUST TO BE GOOD</h3><br>
    Just to be good&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 4em;'>This is
    enough&mdash;enough!</span><br>
    O we who find sin's billows wild and rough,<br>
    Do we not feel how more than any gold<br>
    Would be the blameless life we led of old<br>
    While yet our lips knew but a mother's kiss?<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Ah! though we miss</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>All else but this,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To be good is
    enough!</span><br>
    <br>
    It is enough&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Enough&mdash;just to be
    good!</span><br>
    To lift our hearts where they are understood;<br>
    To let the thirst for worldly power and place<br>
    Go unappeased; to smile back in God's face<br>
    With the glad lips our mothers used to kiss.<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Ah! though we miss</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>All else but this,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To be good is
    enough!</span><br>

    <h3>MY FRIEND</h3><br>
    "He is my friend," I said,&mdash;<br>
    "Be patient!" Overhead<br>
    The skies were drear and dim;<br>
    And lo! the thought of him<br>
    Smiled on my heart&mdash;and then<br>
    The sun shone out again!<br>
    <br>
    "He is my friend!" The words<br>
    Brought summer and the birds;<br>
    And all my winter-time<br>
    Thawed into running rhyme<br>
    And rippled into song,<br>
    Warm, tender, brave and strong.<br>
    <br>
    And so it sings to-day.&mdash;<br>
    So may it sing alway!<br>
    Though waving grasses grow<br>
    Between, and lilies blow<br>
    Their trills of perfume clear<br>
    As laughter to the ear,<br>
    Let each mute measure end<br>
    With "Still he is thy friend."<br>

    <h3>THINKIN' BACK</h3><br>
    I've ben thinkin' back, of late,<br>
    S'prisin'!&mdash;And I'm here to state<br>
    I'm suspicious it's a sign<br>
    Of <i>age</i>, maybe, or decline<br>
    Of my faculties,&mdash;and yit<br>
    I'm not <i>feelin'</i> old a bit&mdash;<br>
    Any more than sixty-four<br>
    Ain't no <i>young</i> man any more!<br>
    <br>
    Thinkin' back's a thing 'at grows<br>
    On a feller, I suppose&mdash;<br>
    Older 'at he gits, i jack,<br>
    More he keeps a-thinkin' back!<br>
    Old as old men git to be,<br>
    Er as middle-aged as me,<br>
    Folks'll find us, eye and mind<br>
    Fixed on what we've left behind&mdash;<br>
    Rehabilitatin'-like<br>
    Them old times we used to hike<br>
    Out barefooted fer the crick,<br>
    'Long 'bout <i>Aprile first</i>&mdash;to pick<br>
    Out some "warmest" place to go<br>
    In a-swimmin'&mdash;<i>Ooh! my-oh!</i><br>
    Wonder now we hadn't died!<br>
    Grate horseradish on my hide<br>
    Jes' <i>a-thinkin'</i> how cold then<br>
    That-'ere worter must 'a' ben!<br>
    <br>
    Thinkin' back&mdash;W'y, goodness me!<br>
    I kin call their names and see<br>
    Every little tad I played<br>
    With, er fought, er was afraid<br>
    Of, and so made <i>him</i> the best<br>
    Friend I had of all the rest!<br>

    </center><br>
    Thinkin' back, I even hear<br>
    Them a-callin', high and clear,<br>
    Up the crick-banks, where they seem<br>
    Still hid in there&mdash;like a dream&mdash;<br>
    And me still a-pantin' on<br>
    The green pathway they have gone!<br>
    Still they hide, by bend er ford&mdash;<br>
    Still they hide&mdash;but, thank the Lord,<br>
    (Thinkin' back, as I have said),<br>
    I hear laughin' on ahead!<br>

    <h3>NOT ALWAYS GLAD WHEN WE SMILE</h3><br>
    We are not always glad when we smile:<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Though we wear a fair face and
    are gay,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the world we
    deceive</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>May not ever believe</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>We could laugh in a happier
    way.&mdash;</span><br>
    Yet, down in the deeps of the soul,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Ofttimes, with our faces
    aglow,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There's an ache and a
    moan</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That we know of
    alone,</span><br>
    And as only the hopeless may know.<br>
    <br>
    We are not always glad when we smile,&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>For the heart, in a tempest of
    pain,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>May live in the
    guise</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of a smile in the
    eyes</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>As a rainbow may live in the
    rain;</span><br>
    And the stormiest night of our woe<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>May hang out a radiant
    star</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whose light in the
    sky</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of despair is a lie</span><br>
    As black as the thunder-clouds are.<br>
    <br>
    We are not always glad when we smile!&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>But the conscience is quick to
    record,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All the sorrow and
    sin</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>We are hiding within</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Is plain in the sight of the
    Lord:</span><br>
    And ever, O ever, till pride<br>

    <h3>HIS ROOM</h3><br>
    "I'm home again, my dear old Room,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>I'm home again, and happy,
    too,</span><br>
    As, peering through the brightening gloom,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>I find myself alone with
    you:</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though brief my stay, nor far
    away,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I missed you&mdash;missed you
    night and day&mdash;</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As wildly yearned for you as
    now.&mdash;</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Old Room, how are you,
    anyhow?</span><br>
    <br>
    "My easy chair, with open arms,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Awaits me just within the
    door;</span><br>
    The littered carpet's woven charms<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Have never seemed so bright
    before,&mdash;</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The old rosettes and
    mignonettes</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And ivy-leaves and
    violets,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Look up as pure and fresh of
    hue</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As though baptized in morning
    dew.</span><br>
    <br>
    "Old Room, to me your homely walls<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Fold round me like the arms of
    love,</span><br>
    And over all my being falls<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>A blessing pure as from
    above&mdash;</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Even as a nestling child
    caressed</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And lulled upon a loving
    breast,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With folded eyes, too glad to
    weep</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And yet too sad for dreams or
    sleep.</span><br>
    <br>
    "You've been so kind to me, old Room&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>So patient in your tender
    care,</span><br>
    My drooping heart in fullest bloom<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Has blossomed for you
    unaware;</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And who but you had cared to
    woo</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A heart so dark, and heavy,
    too,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As in the past you lifted
    mine</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From out the shadow to the
    shine?</span><br>
    <br>
    "For I was but a wayward boy<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>When first you gladly welcomed
    me</span><br>
    And taught me work was truer joy<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Than rioting
    incessantly:</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thus the din that stormed
    within</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The old guitar and
    violin</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Has fallen in a fainter
    tone</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And sweeter, for your sake
    alone.</span><br>
    <br>
    "Though in my absence I have stood<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>In festal halls a favored
    guest,</span><br>
    I missed, in this old quietude,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>My worthy work and worthy
    rest&mdash;</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By <i>this</i> I know that long
    ago</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>You loved me first, and told me
    so</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In art's mute eloquence of
    speech</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The voice of praise may never
    reach.</span><br>
    <br>
    "For lips and eyes in truth's disguise<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Confuse the faces of my
    friends,</span><br>
    Till old affection's fondest ties<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>I find unraveling at the
    ends;</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But as I turn to you, and
    learn</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To meet my griefs with less
    concern,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Your love seems all I have to
    keep</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Me smiling lest I needs must
    weep.</span><br>
    <br>
    "Yet I am happy, and would fain<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Forget the world and all its
    woes;</span><br>
    So set me to my tasks again,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Old Room, and lull me to
    repose:</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And as we glide adown the
    tide</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of dreams, forever side by
    side,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I'll hold your hands as lovers
    do</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their sweethearts' and talk
    love to you."</span><br>

    <h3>THE QUEST</h3><br>
    I am looking for Love. Has he passed this way,<br>
    With eyes as blue as the skies of May,<br>
    And a face as fair as the summer dawn?&mdash;<br>
    You answer back, but I wander on,&mdash;<br>
    For you say: "Oh, yes; but his eyes were gray,<br>
    And his face as dim as a rainy day."<br>
    <br>
    Good friends, I query, I search for Love;<br>
    His eyes are as blue as the skies above,<br>
    And his smile as bright as the midst of May<br>
    When the truce-bird pipes: Has he passed this way?<br>
    And one says: "Ay; but his face, alack!<br>
    Frowned as he passed, and his eyes were black."<br>
    <br>
    O who will tell me of Love? I cry!<br>
    His eyes are as blue as the mid-May sky,<br>
    And his face as bright as the morning sun;<br>
    And you answer and mock me, every one,<br>
    That his eyes were dark, and his face was wan,<br>
    And he passed you frowning and wandered on.<br>
    <br>
    But stout of heart will I onward fare,<br>
    Knowing <i>my</i> Love is beyond&mdash;somewhere,&mdash;<br>
    The Love I seek, with the eyes of blue,<br>
    And the bright, sweet smile unknown of you;<br>
    And on from the hour his trail is found<br>
    I shall sing sonnets the whole year round.<br>

    <h3>THE MULBERRY TREE</h3><br>
    It's many's the scenes which is dear to my mind<br>
    As I think of my childhood so long left behind;<br>
    The home of my birth, with it's old puncheon-floor,<br>
    And the bright morning-glories that growed round the door;<br>
    The warped clab-board roof whare the rain it run off<br>
    Into streams of sweet dreams as I laid in the loft,<br>
    Countin' all of the joys that was dearest to me,<br>
    And a-thinkin' the most of the mulberry tree.<br>
    <br>
    And to-day as I dream, with both eyes wide-awake,<br>
    I can see the old tree, and its limbs as they shake,<br>
    And the long purple berries that rained on the ground<br>
    Whare the pastur' was bald whare we trommpt it around.<br>
    And again, peekin' up through the thick leafy shade,<br>
    I can see the glad smiles of the friends when I strayed<br>
    With my little bare feet from my own mother's knee<br>
    To foller them off to the mulberry tree.<br>

    Leanin' up in the forks, I can see the old rail,<br>
    And the boy climbin' up it, claw, tooth, and toe-nail,<br>
    And in fancy can hear, as he spits on his hands,<br>
    The ring of his laugh and the rip of his pants.<br>
    But that rail led to glory, as certin and shore<br>
    As I'll never climb thare by that rout' any more&mdash;<br>
    What was all the green lauruls of Fame unto me,<br>
    With my brows in the boughs of the mulberry tree!<br>
    <br>
    Then it's who can fergit the old mulberry tree<br>
    That he knowed in the days when his thoughts was as free<br>
    As the flutterin' wings of the birds that flew out<br>
    Of the tall wavin' tops as the boys come about?<br>
    O, a crowd of my memories, laughin' and gay,<br>
    Is a-climbin' the fence of that pastur' to-day,<br>
    And, a-pantin' with joy, as us boys ust to be,<br>
    They go racin' acrost fer the mulberry tree.<br>

    O'er the verge of Where-Away.<br>

    Roses laid their velvet lips<br>
    On our own, with fragrant sips;<br>

    All their sweetness we forgot;&mdash;<br>
    Though the brambles in our track<br>

    "Lie the Lands of Where-Away."<br>
    <br>
    Children at the pasture-bars,<br>

    Waved their hands that we should bide<br>
    With them over eventide;<br>
    Down the dark their voices failed<br>
    Falteringly, as they hailed,<br>
    And died into yesterday&mdash;<br>
    Night ahead and&mdash;Where-Away?<br>
    <br>
    Twining arms about us thrown&mdash;<br>
    Warm caresses, all our own,<br>
    Can but stay us for a spell&mdash;<br>
    Love hath little new to tell<br>
    To the soul in need supreme,<br>
    Aching ever with the dream<br>
    Of the endless bliss it may<br>
    Find in Lands of Where-Away!<br>

    <h3>THE OLD TRUNDLE-BED</h3><br>
    O the old trundle-bed where I slept when a boy!<br>
    What canopied king might not covet the joy?<br>
    The glory and peace of that slumber of mine,<br>
    Like a long, gracious rest in the bosom divine:<br>
    The quaint, homely couch, hidden close from the light,<br>
    But daintily drawn from its hiding at night.<br>
    O a nest of delight, from the foot to the head,<br>
    Was the queer little, clear little, old trundle-bed!<br>
    <br>
    O the old trundle-bed, where I wondering saw<br>
    The stars through the window, and listened with awe<br>
    To the sigh of the winds as they tremblingly crept<br>
    Through the trees where the robin so restlessly slept:<br>
    Where I heard the low, murmurous chirp of the wren,<br>
    And the katydid listlessly chirrup again,<br>
    Till my fancies grew faint and were drowsily led<br>
    Through the maze of the dreams of the old trundle bed.<br>

    O the old trundle-bed! O the old trundle-bed!<br>
    With its plump little pillow, and old-fashioned spread;<br>
    Its snowy-white sheets, and the blankets above,<br>
    Smoothed down and tucked round with the touches of love;<br>
    The voice of my mother to lull me to sleep<br>
    With the old fairy-stories my memories keep<br>
    Still fresh as the lilies that bloom o'er the head<br>
    Once bowed o'er my own in the old trundle-bed.<br>

    <h3>NATURAL PERVERSITIES</h3><br>
    I am not prone to moralize<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>In scientific doubt</span><br>
    On certain facts that Nature tries<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To puzzle us
    about,&mdash;</span><br>
    For I am no philosopher<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Of wise elucidation,</span><br>
    But speak of things as they occur,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>From simple
    observation.</span><br>
    <br>
    I notice <i>little</i> things&mdash;to wit:&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>I never missed a
    train</span><br>
    Because I didn't <i>run</i> for it;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>I never knew it rain</span><br>
    That my umbrella wasn't lent,&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Or, when in my
    possession,</span><br>
    The sun but wore, to all intent,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>A jocular

    </center><br>
    I never knew a creditor<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To dun me for a debt</span><br>
    But I was "cramped" or "busted;" or<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>I never knew one
    yet,</span><br>
    When I had plenty in my purse,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To make the least
    invasion,&mdash;</span><br>
    As I, accordingly perverse,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Have courted no
    occasion.</span><br>
    <br>
    Nor do I claim to comprehend<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>What Nature has in
    view</span><br>
    In giving us the very friend<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To trust we oughtn't
    to.&mdash;</span><br>
    But so it is: The trusty gun<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Disastrously
    exploded</span><br>
    Is always sure to be the one<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>We didn't think was
    loaded.</span><br>
    <br>
    Our moaning is another's mirth,&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And what is worse by
    half,</span><br>
    We say the funniest thing on earth<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And never raise a
    laugh:</span><br>
    Mid friends that love us overwell,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And sparkling jests and
    liquor,</span><br>
    Our hearts somehow are liable<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To melt in tears the
    quicker.</span><br>
    <br>
    We reach the wrong when most we seek<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The right; in like
    effect,</span><br>
    We stay the strong and not the weak&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Do most when we
    neglect.&mdash;</span><br>
    Neglected genius&mdash;truth be said&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>As wild and quick as
    tinder,</span><br>
    The more we seek to help ahead<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The more we seem to
    hinder.</span><br>
    <br>
    I've known the least the greatest, too&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And, on the selfsame
    plan,</span><br>
    The biggest fool I ever knew<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Was quite a little
    man:</span><br>
    We find we ought, and then we won't&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>We prove a thing, then doubt
    it,&mdash;</span><br>
    Know <i>everything</i> but when we don't<br>

    <h3>OUR KIND OF A MAN</h3><br>

    <center>
        I
    </center><br>
    The kind of a man for you and me!<br>
    He faces the world unflinchingly,<br>
    And smites, as long as the wrong resists,<br>
    With a knuckled faith and force like fists:<br>
    He lives the life he is preaching of,<br>
    And loves where most is the need of love;<br>
    His voice is clear to the deaf man's ears,<br>
    And his face sublime through the blind man's tears;<br>
    The light shines out where the clouds were dim,<br>
    And the widow's prayer goes up for him;<br>
    The latch is clicked at the hovel door<br>
    And the sick man sees the sun once more,<br>
    And out o'er the barren fields he sees<br>
    Springing blossoms and waving trees,<br>
    Feeling as only the dying may,<br>
    That God's own servant has come that way,<br>
    Smoothing the path as it still winds on<br>
    Through the Golden Gate where his loved have gone.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <center>
        II
    </center><br>
    The kind of a man for me and you!<br>
    However little of worth we do<br>
    He credits full, and abides in trust<br>
    That time will teach us how more is just.<br>
    He walks abroad, and he meets all kinds<br>
    Of querulous and uneasy minds,<br>
    And, sympathizing, he shares the pain<br>
    Of the doubts that rack us, heart and brain;<br>
    And, knowing this, as we grasp his hand,<br>
    We are surely coming to understand!<br>
    He looks on sin with pitying eyes&mdash;<br>
    E'en as the Lord, since Paradise,&mdash;<br>
    Else, should we read, "Though our sins should glow<br>
    As scarlet, they shall be white as snow"?&mdash;<br>
    And, feeling still, with a grief half glad,<br>
    That the bad are as good as the good are bad,<br>
    He strikes straight out for the Right&mdash;and he<br>
    Is the kind of a man for you and me!<br>

    And know each day is a yesterday,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>When we size it up, at

    Same as I said when my <i>boyhood</i> went<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And I knowed <i>we</i> had to
    quit,&mdash;</span><br>
    "It's <i>got</i> to be, and it's <i>goin'</i> to
    be!"&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>So I said "Good-by" to

    <br>
    It's <i>got</i> to be, and it's <i>goin'</i> to be!<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>So at least I always
    try</span><br>
    To kind o' say in a hearty way,&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>"Well, it's <i>got</i> to be.
    Good-by!"</span><br>
    <br>
    The time jes melts like a late, last snow,&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>When it's <i>got</i> to be, it
    melts!</span><br>
    But I aim to keep a cheerful mind,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Ef I can't keep nothin'
    else!</span><br>
    I knowed, when I come to twenty-one,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>That I'd soon be
    twenty-two,&mdash;</span><br>
    So I waved one hand at the soft young man,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And I said, "Good-by to
    <i>you</i>!"</span><br>
    <br>
    It's <i>got</i> to be, and it's <i>goin'</i> to be!<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>So at least I always

    To kind o' say, in a cheerful way,&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>"Well, it's <i>got</i> to
    be.&mdash;Good-by!"</span><br>
    <br>
    They kep' a-goin', the years and years,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Yet still I smiled and
    smiled,&mdash;</span><br>
    For I'd said "Good-by" to my single life,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And I now had a wife and
    child:</span><br>
    Mother and son and the father&mdash;one,&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Till, last, on her bed of
    pain,</span><br>
    She jes' smiled up, like she always done,&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And I said "Good-by"
    again.</span><br>
    <br>
    It's <i>got</i> to be, and it's <i>goin'</i> to be!<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>So at least I always

    Was more than a pride and joy to me,<br>

    He gimme the slip, when the War broke out,<br>

    Never knowed till the first right's end ...<br>

    "Good-by."</span><br>
    <br>
    It's <i>got</i> to be, and it's <i>goin'</i> to be!<br>

    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And this is the thing I'll
    do,&mdash;</span><br>
    With my last breath I will laugh, O Death,<br>

    It's <i>got</i> to be! And again I say,&mdash;<br>

    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And the lowering clouds
    o'erhead</span><br>
    Wept in a silent sorrow<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Where the sweet sunshine lay
    dead;</span><br>
    And a wind came out of the eastward<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Like an endless sigh of
    pain,</span><br>
    And the leaves fell down in the pathway<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And writhed in the falling
    rain.</span><br>
    <br>
    I had tried in a brave endeavor<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To chord my harp with the
    sun,</span><br>
    But the strings would slacken ever,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And the task was a weary
    one:</span><br>
    And so, like a child impatient<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And sick of a
    discontent,</span><br>
    I bowed in a shower of teardrops<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And mourned with the
    instrument.</span><br>
    <br>
    And lo! as I bowed, the splendor<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Of the sun bent over
    me,</span><br>
    With a touch as warm and tender<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>As a father's hand might
    be:</span><br>
    And even as I felt its presence,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>My clouded soul grew
    bright,</span><br>
    And the tears, like the rain of morning,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Melted in mists of
    light.</span><br>

    Reach your hand to me, my friend,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>With its heartiest
    caress&mdash;</span><br>
    Sometime there will come an end<br>

    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sometime I may ask in

    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Holds it ever back from
    me.</span><br>
    <br>
    Sometime I may need it so,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Groping somewhere in the
    night,</span><br>
    It will seem to me as though<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Just a touch, however
    light,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Would make all the darkness
    day,</span><br>

    April-shower</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of my tears to this fair
    hour.</span><br>
    <br>
    O the present is too sweet<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To go on forever
    thus!</span><br>
    Round the corner of the street<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Who can say what waits for
    us?&mdash;</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Meeting&mdash;greeting, night
    and day,</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Faring each the selfsame
    way&mdash;</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Still somewhere the path must
    end.&mdash;</span><br>
    <span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Reach your hand to me, my
    friend!</span><br>

    <h3>TO MY OLD FRIEND, WILLIAM LEACHMAM</h3><br>
    Fer forty year and better you have been a friend to me,<br>
    Through days of sore afflictions and dire adversity,<br>
    You allus had a kind word of counsul to impart,<br>
    Which was like a healin' 'intment to the sorrow of my hart.<br>
    <br>
    When I burried my first womern, William Leachman, it was you<br>
    Had the only consolation that I could listen to&mdash;<br>
    Fer I knowed you had gone through it and had rallied from the blow,<br>
    And when you said I'd do the same, I knowed you'd ort to know.<br>
    <br>
    But that time I'll long remember; how I wundered here and thare&mdash;<br>
    Through the settin'-room and kitchen, and out in the open air&mdash;<br>
    And the snowflakes whirlin', whirlin', and the fields a frozen glare,<br>
    And the neghbors' sleds and wagons congergatin' ev'rywhare.<br>
    <br>
    I turned my eyes to'rds heaven, but the sun was hid away;<br>
    I turned my eyes to'rds earth again, but all was cold and gray;<br>
    And the clock, like ice a-crackin', clickt the icy hours in two&mdash;<br>
    And my eyes'd never thawed out ef it hadn't been fer you!<br>
    <br>
    We set thare by the smoke-house&mdash;me and you out thare alone&mdash;<br>
    Me a-thinkin'&mdash;you a-talkin' in a soothin' undertone&mdash;<br>
    You a-talkin'&mdash;me a-thinkin' of the summers long ago,<br>
    And a-writin' "Marthy&mdash;Marthy" with my finger in the snow!<br>
    <br>

        <img src="images/illus0140.jpg" width="360" height="475" alt="Horses pulling a wagon" title="" />
    </center><br>
    William Leachman, I can see you jest as plane as I could then;<br>
    And your hand is on my shoulder, and you rouse me up again,<br>
    And I see the tears a-drippin' from your own eyes, as you say:<br>
    "Be rickonciled and bear it&mdash;we but linger fer a day!"<br>
    <br>
    At the last Old Settlers' Meetin' we went j'intly, you and me&mdash;<br>
    Your hosses and my wagon, as you wanted it to be;<br>
    And sence I can remember, from the time we've neghbored here,<br>
    In all sich friendly actions you have double-done your sheer.<br>
    <br>
    It was better than the meetin', too, that nine-mile talk we had<br>
    Of the times when we first settled here and travel was so bad;<br>
    When we had to go on hoss-back, and sometimes on "Shanks's mare,"<br>
    And "blaze" a road fer them behind that had to travel thare.<br>
    <br>
    And now we was a-trottin' 'long a level gravel pike,<br>
    In a big two-hoss road-wagon, jest as easy as you
    like&mdash;<br>
    Two of us on the front seat, and our wimmern-folks behind,<br>
    A-settin' in theyr Winsor-cheers in perfect peace of mind!<br>
    <br>
    And we pinted out old landmarks, nearly faded out of sight:&mdash;<br>
    Thare they ust to rob the stage-coach; thare Gash Morgan had the fight<br>
    With the old stag-deer that pronged him&mdash;how he battled fer his
    life,<br>
    And lived to prove the story by the handle of his knife.<br>
    <br>
    Thare the first griss-mill was put up in the Settlement, and we<br>
    Had tuck our grindin' to it in the Fall of
    Forty-three&mdash;<br>
    When we tuck our rifles with us, techin' elbows all the way,<br>
    And a-stickin' right together ev'ry minute, night and day.<br>
    <br>

        <img src="images/illus0144.jpg" width="363" height="475" alt="Two men talking" title="" />
    </center><br>
    Thare ust to stand the tavern that they called the "Travelers' Rest,"<br>
    And thare, beyent the covered bridge, "The Counter-fitters' Nest"&mdash;<br>
    Whare they claimed the house was ha'nted&mdash;that a man was murdered thare,<br>
    And burried underneath the floor, er 'round the place somewhare.<br>
    <br>
    And the old Plank-road they laid along in Fifty-one er two&mdash;<br>
    You know we talked about the times when that old road was new:<br>
    How "Uncle Sam" put down that road and never taxed the State<br>
    Was a problem, don't you rickollect, we couldn't <i>dim</i>-onstrate?<br>
    <br>
    Ways was devius, William Leachman, that me and you has past;<br>
    But as I found you true at first, I find you true at last;<br>
    And, now the time's a-comin' mighty nigh our jurney's end,<br>
    I want to throw wide open all my soul to you, my friend.<br>
    <br>
    With the stren'th of all my bein', and the heat of hart and brane,<br>
    And ev'ry livin' drop of blood in artery and vane,<br>
    I love you and respect you, and I venerate your name,<br>

    <h3>A BACKWARD LOOK</h3><br>
    As I sat smoking, alone, yesterday,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And lazily leaning back in my
    chair,</span><br>
    Enjoying myself in a general way&mdash;<br>
    Allowing my thoughts a holiday<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>From weariness, toil and
    care,&mdash;</span><br>
    My fancies&mdash;doubtless, for ventilation&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Left ajar the gates of my
    mind,&mdash;</span><br>
    And Memory, seeing the situation,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Slipped out in street of "Auld
    Lang Syne."</span><br>
    <br>
    Wandering ever with tireless feet<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Through scenes of silence, and
    jubilee</span><br>
    Of long-hushed voices; and faces sweet<br>
    Were thronging the shadowy side of the street<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>As far as the eye could
    see;</span><br>
    Dreaming again, in anticipation,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The same old dreams of our
    boyhood's days</span><br>
    That never come true, from the vague sensation<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Of walking asleep in the
    world's strange ways.</span><br>
    <br>
    Away to the house where I was born!<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And there was the selfsame
    clock that ticked</span><br>
    From the close of dusk to the burst of morn,<br>
    When life-warm hands plucked the golden corn<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And helped when the apples were
    picked.</span><br>
    And the "chany-dog" on the mantel-shelf,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>With the gilded collar and
    yellow eyes,</span><br>
    Looked just as at first, when I hugged myself<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Sound asleep with the dear
    surprise.</span><br>
    <br>
    And down to the swing in the locust tree,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Where the grass was worn from
    the trampled ground</span><br>
    And where "Eck" Skinner, "Old" Carr, and three<br>
    Or four such other boys used to be<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Doin' "sky-scrapers," or
    "whirlin' round:"</span><br>
    And again Bob climbed for the bluebird's nest,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And again "had shows" in the
    buggy-shed</span><br>
    Of Guymon's barn, where still, unguessed,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The old ghosts romp through the
    best days dead!</span><br>
    <br>
    And again I gazed from the old school-room<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>With a wistful look of a long
    June day,</span><br>
    When on my cheek was the hectic bloom<br>
    Caught of Mischief, as I presume&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>He had such a "partial"
    way,</span><br>
    It seemed, toward me.&mdash;And again I thought<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Of a probable likelihood to
    be</span><br>
    Kept in after school&mdash;for a girl was caught<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Catching a note from
    me.</span><br><br>

    </center><br>
    <br>
    And down through the woods to the swimming-hole&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Where the big, white, hollow,
    old sycamore grows,&mdash;</span><br>
    And we never cared when the water was cold.<br>
    And always "clucked" the boy that told<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>On the fellow that tied the
    clothes.&mdash;</span><br>
    When life went so like a dreamy rhyme<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>That it seems to me now that
    then</span><br>
    The world was having a jollier time<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Than it ever will have
    again.</span><br>

    And Love, with laughter on his lips,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And Peace, of passive
    mind;</span><br>
    While out across the deeps of night,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>With lifted sails of
    prayer,</span><br>
    We voyage off in quest of light,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Nor find it
    anywhere.</span><br>
    <br>
    O Thou who wroughtest earth and sea,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Yet keepest from our
    eyes</span><br>
    The shores of an eternity<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>In calms of
    Paradise,</span><br>
    Blow back upon our foolish quest<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>With all the driving
    rain</span><br>
    Of blinding tears and wild unrest,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And waft us home

    <h3>THE OLD GUITAR</h3><br>
    Neglected now is the old guitar<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And moldering into
    decay;</span><br>
    Fretted with many a rift and scar<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>That the dull dust hides
    away,</span><br>
    While the spider spins a silver star<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>In its silent lips
    to-day.</span><br>
    <br>
    The keys hold only nerveless strings&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The sinews of brave old
    airs</span><br>
    Are pulseless now; and the scarf that clings<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>So closely here
    declares</span><br>
    A sad regret in its ravelings<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And the faded hue it
    wears.</span><br>
    <br>
    But the old guitar, with a lenient grace,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Has cherished a smile for
    me;</span><br>
    And its features hint of a fairer face<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>That comes with a
    memory</span><br>
    Of a flower-and-perfume-haunted place<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And a moonlit
    balcony.</span><br>
    <br>
    Music sweeter than words confess<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Or the minstrel's powers
    invent,</span><br>
    Thrilled here once at the light caress<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Of the fairy hands that
    lent</span><br>
    This excuse for the kiss I press<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>On the dear old
    instrument.</span><br>
    <br>
    The rose of pearl with the jeweled stem<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Still blooms; and the tiny
    sets</span><br>
    In the circle all are here; the gem<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>In the keys, and the silver
    frets;</span><br>
    But the dainty fingers that danced o'er them&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Alas for the heart's
    regrets!&mdash;</span><br>
    <br>
    Alas for the loosened strings to-day,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And the wounds of rift and
    scar</span><br>
    On a worn old heart, with its roundelay<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Enthralled with a stronger
    bar</span><br>
    That Fate weaves on, through a dull decay<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Like that of the old
    guitar!</span><br>

    By the fireplace here at night&mdash;<br>
    Wood all in,&mdash;and room all bright,<br>
    Warm and snug, and folks all here:<br>

    down</span><br>
    And visit a fellow out here in the woods&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Out of the dust of the
    town?</span><br>
    Can't you forget you're a Judge<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And put by your dolorous
    frown</span><br>
    And tan your wan face in the smile of a friend&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Can't you arrange to come
    down?</span><br>
    <br>
    Can't you forget for a while<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The arguments prosy and
    drear,&mdash;</span><br>
    To lean at full-length in indefinite rest<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>In the lap of the greenery
    here?</span><br>
    Can't you kick over "the Bench,"<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And "husk" yourself out of your
    gown</span><br>
    To dangle your legs where the fishing is good&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Can't you arrange to come
    down?</span><br>
    <br>
    Bah! for your office of State!<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And bah! for its technical
    lore!</span><br>
    What does our President, high in his chair,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>But wish himself low as
    before!</span><br>
    Pick between peasant and king,&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Poke your bald head through a
    crown</span><br>
    Or shadow it here with the laurels of Spring!&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Can't you arrange to come
    down?</span><br>
    <br>
    "Judge it" out <i>here</i>, if you will,&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The birds are in session by
    dawn;</span><br>
    You can draw, not <i>complaints</i>, but a sketch of the
    hill<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And a breath that your betters
    have drawn;</span><br>
    You can open your heart, like a case,<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To a jury of kine, white and
    brown,</span><br>
    And their verdict of "Moo" will just satisfy you!&mdash;<br>
    <span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Can't you arrange to come

    Pure and clear as morning-dew:<br>
    <br>
    And, as we are rising there,<br>
    Doubly dow'rd to hear and see,<br>
    We shall thus be made aware<br>
    Of an eerie piping, heard<br>
    High above the happy bird<br>
    In the hazel: And then we,<br>
    Just across the creek, shall see<br>
    (Hah! the goaty rascal!) Pan<br>
    Hoof it o'er the sloping green,<br>
    Mad with his own melody,<br>

    <h3>HER BEAUTIFUL HANDS</h3><br>
    O your hands&mdash;they are strangely fair!<br>
    Fair&mdash;for the jewels that sparkle there,&mdash;<br>
    Fair&mdash;for the witchery of the spell<br>
    That ivory keys alone can tell;<br>
    But when their delicate touches rest<br>
    Here in my own do I love them best,<br>
    As I clasp with eager acquisitive spans<br>
    My glorious treasure of beautiful hands!<br>
    <br>
    Marvelous&mdash;wonderful&mdash;beautiful hands!<br>
    They can coax roses to bloom in the strands<br>
    Of your brown tresses; and ribbons will twine.<br>
    Under mysterious touches of thine,<br>
    Into such knots as entangle the soul,<br>
    And fetter the heart under such a control<br>
    As only the strength of my love understands&mdash;<br>
    My passionate love for your beautiful hands.<br>
    <br>
    As I remember the first fair touch<br>
    Of those beautiful hands that I love so much,<br>
    I seem to thrill as I then was thrilled,<br>
    Kissing the glove that I found unfilled&mdash;<br>
    When I met your gaze, and the queenly bow,<br>
    As you said to me, laughingly, "Keep it now!"<br>
    And dazed and alone in a dream I stand<br>
    Kissing this ghost of your beautiful hand.<br>
    <br>
    When first I loved, in the long ago,<br>
    And held your hand as I told you so&mdash;<br>
    Pressed and caressed it and gave it a kiss,<br>
    And said "I could die for a hand like this!"<br>
    Little I dreamed love's fulness yet<br>
    Had to ripen when eyes were wet,<br>
    And prayers were vain in their wild demands<br>
    For one warm touch of your beautiful hands.<br>
    <br>
    Beautiful Hands! O Beautiful Hands!<br>
    Could you reach out of the alien lands<br>
    Where you are lingering, and give me, to-night,<br>
    Only a touch&mdash;were it ever so light&mdash;<br>
    My heart were soothed, and my weary brain<br>
    Would lull itself into rest again;<br>
    For there is no solace the world commands<br>
    Like the caress of your beautiful hands.<br>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
